This package contains the lab material used in the master level
course "Computer Hardware - a System on Chip". This is given
at Linköpings Universitet.

The design is based on the OR1200 cpu from opencores.org, and builds
a complete image compressing (JPEG based) system running uClinux.
The hardware consists of a Avnet Virtex-II development board with
added extension boards with ehternet, switches, camera interface etc.

The initial lab0 is using the newer zedboard, with a USBUART PMOD attached.
